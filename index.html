                        <b>Gigo</b> is a static website generator written in Go allowing web developers to write
                        websites in core HTML, JS and CSS while benefiting from features missing in HTML 5 such as
                        including and reusing pages. When using Gigo there is no need to learn a custom templating
                        language. Just work with the standards core HTML, JS and CSS and write portable websites.
                    </p>
                        <p>HTML specification does not offer a way of including pages and Gigo resolves this simply and elegantly.</p>
                    <p>Gigo has the following features:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Tag <i>&lt;<b>gigo-include</b> file=* /&gt;</i> : includes other HTML pages in
                                the page using this tag.</li>
                            <li>Tag <i>&lt;<b>gigo-include-in</b> file=* /&gt;</i> : the page using this tag asks to be
                                included in another template page, reducing further code duplications.</li>
                            <li>It is written in Go and comes with a binary which is self-contained and does not
                                require the installation of a third party library or SDK.</li>
                            <li>Because it does not rely on a database, you can commit your work in GIT and generate anytime
                                a static website using gigo binary.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
